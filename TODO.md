# To-Do List
### Minimum functionality
- Finish authentication flow with Entra ID
- Get the resources set up according with project manager's wishes
- Set up checkin/out for students
- Set up an overview screen for admins.

### Additional Functionality 
- Photos for resources
- QR scanning
  + Should scan barcode/qr on resources. (maybe also student ID?)

### Polishing needed
- Auth level based on group membership in Entra ID
  - PM expressed interest in teachers being identified by their groups in the AD
  - Current auth level is decided by a regex in the login.js file.
