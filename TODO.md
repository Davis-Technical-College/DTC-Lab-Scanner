# To-Do List
### Next
- Add security rules to the Firebase storage and realtime database
- Improve form validation for resource management

### After
- Display database records on the main Resources screen
  - Show image thumbnail, name, current user, and number of alerts
  - Tapping the resource will open the full details

### Later
- Add checkout functionality for regular users
- Show checkout history on the resource details screen
- Add user list for administrators, based on active users
  - An active user is one who has checked out a resource in the last 3 months
  - Will also have checkout history, but per user rather than per resource
- Implement cleanup functions for both user and cloud storage
  - Remove unused images to free storage space
